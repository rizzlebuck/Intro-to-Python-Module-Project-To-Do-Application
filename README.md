📝 To Do List App

A simple Python console application for managing a to-do list.
Users can add, view, and delete tasks from a list, or quit the app when finished.

🚀 Features

Add Task → Input a task and add it to your to-do list.

View Tasks → Display all your current tasks, numbered in order.

Delete Task → Remove a task from the list by selecting its number.

Quit App → Exit the program safely with a goodbye message.

📋 How It Works

When you run the program, you’ll see a menu:

Please enter which task you would like to perform from the options below:
1. Add Task
2. View Task
3. Delete Task
4. Quit

Type either the number (1, 2, 3, 4) or the name (add, view, delete, quit) of the action you want.

The app will guide you through each option:

Adding requires typing the task description.

Viewing lists all tasks with numbers.

Deleting asks for the task number to remove.

The app keeps looping until you choose to quit.


⚠️ Notes

If you try to delete a task with an invalid number, the program will ask you to try again.

Input is not case-sensitive (e.g. Add, add, or ADD all work).

Extra spaces before/after input are ignored.
